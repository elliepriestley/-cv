## About Me 

After spending over three years in Executive Search, I sought a more dynamic career path that fosters continuous learning. I found my passion in the creative potential of code, where I enjoy integrating my client-facing background into projects, striving to build accessible and user-friendly applications. 

My time in a start-up environment has shaped me into a self-driven professional, capable of thriving in high-paced and challenging settings. Living and working abroad has enriched my perspective, enhancing my adaptability and problem-solving skills.

Now, I am pursuing a career in Software Engineering due to its inherent demand for persistent education and curiosity. My goal is to leverage my unique blend of experiences to drive innovation and efficiency in the tech industry, and I'm particularly interested in roles where I can make a significant impact on end-user experiences.

## Skills

#### Effective Communication
- **Clarity:** Honed the ability to convey complex ideas clearly through Executive Search experience. Successfully adapted communication style to diverse audiences, from coaching team members to consulting with senior stakeholders, candidates and clients. This was instrumental in building strong relationships and winning new business.
- **Public Speaking:** Confidence in public speaking with experience creating and delivering engaging workshops to CEOs. Incorporated visuals and interactive elements for better understanding and stakeholder engagement. 

- Clear and empathetic communication is crucial in my engineering projects for understanding and addressing the needs of team members, clients, and users. This has led to more productive relationships and smoother project execution, vital in developing high-quality software solutions.

#### Collaboration
- **Team Collaboration:**  Demonstrated the ability to work effectively within Engineering teams, evidenced by winning the Showcode's Athena Hackathon top theme prize (July 2023, [Winning Pitch: Talent Tap](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFnZ3vUgiE/B0xfEiwSlyoJMT2aYiNwsw/view?utm_content=DAFnZ3vUgiE&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink)) for the category with the most entries. Implemented frequent check-ins, leveraged individual skills, and fostered open, respectful challenges, leading to innovative solutions.

Successfully proposed and implemented innovative hiring strategies in the Executive Search industry catering to niche and senior roles. Swiftly adapted to client needs and strategized solutions to meet them, i.e. proposed 'high potential' junior candidates to address budget mismatches. Effectively communicate these solutions to clients using a comprehensive view of the job market and successful case studies.
