## About Me 

After spending over three years in Executive Search, I sought a more dynamic career path that fosters continuous learning. I found my passion in the creative potential of code, where I enjoy integrating my client-facing background into projects, striving to build accessible and user-friendly applications. 

My time in a start-up environment has shaped me into a self-driven professional, capable of thriving in high-paced and challenging settings. Living and working abroad has enriched my perspective, enhancing my adaptability and problem-solving skills.

Now, I am pursuing a career in Software Engineering due to its inherent demand for persistent education and curiosity. My goal is to leverage my unique blend of experiences to drive innovation and efficiency in the tech industry, and I'm particularly interested in roles where I can make a significant impact on end-user experiences.

## Skills

#### Communication
Due to my background in Executive Search, I have honed my ability to convey complex ideas in an accessible and engaging manner. This skill was particularly useful in my role as Senior Consultant, where I was often responsible for coaching new team members. My communication skills have also been crucial in client-facing environments, as the ability to adapt my communication style to different audiences and contexts proved key to building strong relationships with both clients and team members, leading to winning new business as well as completing current projects to a high standard. My experience in delivering workshops to senior stakeholders, including CEOs, also helped me develop confidence in public speaking. I make these sessions engaging by incorporating visuals and interactive elements. This approach has not only facilitated a better understanding of the content but also improved stakeholder engagement. I have found clear and empathetic communication to be crucial in software engineering projects for understanding and addressing the needs of team members, clients, and users effectively. This has led to more productive relationships and smoother project execution, which is vital in developing high-quality software solutions.

#### Collaboration
The ability to work effectively in a team was crucial as a Senior Consultant. Confidence, both in yourself and the product, is vital to translating business opportunities into clients. Empathizing with peers and noticing when individuals' confidence levels were falling, usually due to dips in the market, are important factors in working as part of a successful team. Regular check-ins were important to spot these instances and I found that reallocating work between different team members for short periods was an effective way to build confidence levels. This allowed for mental breaks and for members to return to projects with fresh and updated perspectives.  

My experience of effective team collaboration has been incredibly useful in the context of Software Engineering. I recently entered Showcode's Athena Hackathon (July 2023), and won the theme prize with my team, due in no small part to our ability to collaborate effectively. We used frequent check-ins and made use of our individual skills and experiences to brainstorm and then delegate effectively. For example, as our app was focused on a solution to foster more diversity, fairness and efficiency in tech recruitment, we made use of my knowledge of client expectations to shape our product. We cultivated an honest space where challenge was accepted, but always respectful in tone, to ensure that everyone felt safe to share ideas, leading to more innovative solutions. After presenting our business plan to over 200 people, we won the top prize for the category with the most entries.

#### Problem Solving and Adaptability
My experience living and working abroad, as well as in start-up environments, demonstrates my strong adaptability and problem-solving skills. Working in a start-up environment has honed my ability to thrive in high-paced, challenging settings, and handle unforeseen circumstances. I have successfully navigated through unexpected changes, and have often leveraged my creativity to devise unique solutions to complex problems. While working as a Senior Consultant at Melium Consulting, I was frequently tasked with delivering exceptional shortlists for niche and senior roles. This required me to rapidly adapt to the specific needs of different clients, and devise strategic solutions to meet their unique requirements. 

A common challenge in the Executive Search industry is the mismatch of what a company is willing to offer versus the level of experience they are looking to hire. To overcome this challenge, I would often need to propose more junior 'high potential' candidates who would prove incredibly capable but required some level of training. Effectively communicating this solution to clients was key to winning their support and progressing with the proposed candidates. Providing the client with an overall picture of the job market, while also presenting previous case studies where this strategy had been successful, allowed me to capture the imagination of the client and realise the potential of candidates.

I have found adaptability to be a frequently utilised skill in my Software Engineering projects, allowing me to quickly adapt to new programming languages or frameworks, as well as devising innovative solutions to complex problems.
