## About Me 

After spending over three years in Executive Search, I sought a more dynamic career path that fosters continuous learning. I found my passion in the creative potential of code, where I enjoy integrating my client-facing background into projects, striving to build accessible and user-friendly applications. 

My time in a start-up environment has shaped me into a self-driven professional, capable of thriving in high-paced and challenging settings. Living and working abroad has enriched my perspective, enhancing my adaptability and problem-solving skills. 

Now, I eagerly pursue a career in Software Engineering due to its inherent demand for lifelong learning and curiosity. My goal is to leverage my unique blend of experiences to drive innovation and efficiency in the tech industry, and I'm particularly interested in roles where I can make a significant impact on end-user experiences.

## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Another skill


## Education

#### Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Your University / College (start_date to end_date)

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person
